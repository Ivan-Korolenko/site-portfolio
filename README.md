# What is this?
It's my portfolio website repository. It contains all the code that I've wrote for my website. 
You can use it freely for your purposes. Maybe you'll find something useful here.

I started this project in 2017. All that I did back then can be seen in the original commit.
In 2018 I decided to upgrade and rework it a bit.
