                    <li>Developed the description of the logic of the entire frontend in direct coordination with business customers</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented the architecture of the entire frontend</li>
                    <li>
                    In 2 days I had to write all the necessary messenger functionality for the initial launch (architecture, chat switching, messaging, history, loaders, updating user information, etc). All the code that was written back then still works in a real application. I managed to finish the basic version of the project within the required time, while  working on two other major projects of the company
                    </li>
                    <li>I wrote about 90% of the frontend part of the project.
                    Pure ES6 + React + Redux was chosen as a technology stack.
                    The application is written in a functional style with a "command center" architecture that manages the interactions between multiple "dumb components"

                    <li>In 4 months from scratch to launch with full functionality was created the frontend of the application, which is an improved analogue of Telegram Web</li>
                    <li>Operators and business customers are happy with the work of the new application</li>
                    <li>Thanks to the app operators have become faster and better in customer service, thereby increasing company revenue</li>

                    The idea of the project was to combine the functionality of several pages in one.
                    I designed the project architecture. Everything is implemented on the latest version of React using the best practices. Many universal clean functions for various purposes that can be used in any project were created in the process of development.
